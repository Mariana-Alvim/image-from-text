## Overview

In this project, it was used the min_dalle Python library to load the pre-trained DALL·E-mini model and then generate images based on text descriptions. DALL·E-mini is an image generation model that can create images from descriptive text.

## Features

- Image generation from text descriptions.
- The ability to adjust model hyperparameters to customize image output.
- Usage examples and sample code.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- min_dalle
